# 🌸 Menstrual Cycle Prediction using LSTM, ARIMA & Regression Models

A machine learning-powered system to predict future menstrual cycle dates based on historical data, user demographics, and time series trends. This project leverages deep learning and regression techniques to handle real-world variability and outliers in cycle patterns.

---
## 📌 Features

- Predicts upcoming menstrual cycle dates based on past cycle lengths
- Uses a hybrid of statistical, deep learning, and robust regression models.

## 🔍 Models Used

| Model              | Purpose                                                                 |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **LSTM**           | Captures long-term dependencies and patterns in time-series data        |
| **ARIMA**          | Statistical baseline for modeling linear temporal trends                 |
| **Huber Regression** | Robust to outliers and irregular cycle data                             |
| **Lasso Regression** | Performs feature selection to reduce overfitting                       |
| **OMP (Orthogonal Matching Pursuit)** | Greedy feature selection for sparse data representation         |
